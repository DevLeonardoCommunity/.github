<h1 align="center">Learning Web Development through Open Source</h1>

The headline above is our mission, and the reason why this community exists.

Open Source Software brings to the world a lot of benefits, from freedom to improved security, but one aspect that also deserves some recognition is being able to build in public and learn collectively from everyone else's experience. For free. Isn't that great?

The community projects you'll find in this GitHub Organization won't have the goal of launching the most successful product but rather improving our skills in building them together.

Everyone is welcome to participate in the projects and join the community!

## Projects

We're currently building two projects:
- [GitHub Stats](https://github.com/DevLeonardoCommunity/github-stats): Built in Nextjs is a tool to visualize some of your GitHub stats based on your contributions.
- [Billsplit](https://github.com/DevLeonardoCommunity/billsplit): Built in Qwik, is a tool helping friends sharing equally their expenses for travels or parties.
